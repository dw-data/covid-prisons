# COVID: How Europe’s prisons have fared in the pandemic

Prisons make fertile breeding grounds for viruses, yet administrations have revealed little about COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccinations in Europe’s prisons. Data from 29 countries show the pandemic’s impact on prisons.

This project is a collaboration within the [European Data Journalism Network](https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/).

**Project lead:** [Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/data/t-43091100)

  setNames(c("country", "date", "inmates", "staff", "capacity")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(inmates)) %>% mutate(date = as.Date(date))

```

- Data on cases, deaths and vaccinations in the general population `covid_pop`.
  (**Source:** [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer), extracted on 2021-11-21)

```{r}
covid_pop = read.csv("data/owid-covid-data-2021-11-21.csv") %>% select(1:4,11,14,42,43) %>%
  filter(iso_code %in% c("ALB","AUT","BEL","BGR","CHE","CYP","CZE","DEU","DNK","ESP","EST","FIN","FRA","GRC","HRV","HUN","IRL","ITA","LTU","LUX","LVA","MDA","MLT","MNE","NLD","NOR","POL","PRT","ROU","SVK","SVN","SWE")) %>% 
  transmute(location, date = as.Date(date),
         cases = total_cases_per_million/10^6,
         deaths = total_deaths_per_million/10^6,
         `people with at least 1 dose` = people_vaccinated_per_hundred/100,
         `fully vaccinated people` = people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred/100) %>% 
  pivot_longer(3:6, names_to = "type", values_to = "value_population_rel")
```

- Filter all datasets for countries included in analysis

```{r}
c_filter = c("Andorra","Armenia","Azerbaijan","BH: Rep. Srpska",
             "Georgia","Iceland","Liechtenstein","Monaco","North Macedonia",
             "Russian Fed.","San Marino","Serbia (Republic of)","Turkey",
             "UK: Engl. & Wales","UK: North. Ireland","UK: Scotland")
d = d %>% filter(!(country %in% c_filter))
d_vax = d_vax %>% filter(!(country %in% c_filter))
d_pop = d_pop %>% filter(!(country %in% c_filter))
rm(c_filter)
```



# 2 Data overview

Main dataset columns:
```{r}
names(d)
```

Chart of available data points:
```{r include=FALSE}
d_plot = d %>% group_by(country) %>% filter(max(date) > as.Date("2021-01-01"))

ggplot(d_plot, aes(date, country)) +
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle("Available data points per country")
```
![](scripts/prisons_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

Number of countries by geographic levels of data:
```{r echo=TRUE}
d %>% group_by(level) %>% summarize(n = length(unique(country))) %>% knitr::kable()
```

4 countries have regional data that might need to be aggregated to the national level:
```{r echo=TRUE}
d %>% filter(level == "regional") %>% `$`(country) %>% unique
```


# 3 Consolidate regional data

Data needs to be aggregated if regional data is not available on the national level for the same dates. That is the case for the following countries:

```{r echo=TRUE}
d %>% 
  group_by(country, date) %>%
  filter("regional" %in% level) %>% 
  mutate(agg = !("national" %in% level)) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(agg = any(agg)) %>% knitr::kable()
```

Of the 4 countries with regional data, Germany and Spain (State Adm.) have to be summed up to provide national figures.

About the regional data:

- regional data for `Germany` includes regional data for all 16 states, although in varying levels of detail
- regional data for `Spain (State Adm.)` includes regional data for 18 autonomous cities and communities of Spain, excluding Catalonia, for these 4 points in time: `2020-06-21, 2020-12-31, 2021-03-31, 2021-08-03`.

```{r}
d_regional = d %>% filter(country %in% c("Germany","Spain (State Adm.)"), level == "regional")
```


## Plot case numbers by time and region for Germany

To see how complete a picture the regional data for Germany provide, we check to see whether the regions with the highest case numbers also provided relatively frequent data updates.

```{r include=FALSE}
ggplot(d_regional %>% filter(country == "Germany"), aes(date, region)) +
    geom_point(aes(size = cases_inmates)) +
    geom_text(aes(label = cases_inmates), vjust = -.5, size = 3)
```
![](scripts/prisons_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

- **Spain:** data present for all regions for the same points in time
- **Germany:** regions with higher case numbers have provide more data points, regions with only few available data points have relatively low numbers

Aggregating across regions should provide a reasonably complete picture for Germany. Case numbers should be viewed as minimum case numbers for any given point in time.

Vaccination data for Germany is only sporadically available and should not be aggregated to the national level.

## Aggregate regional data to national level

- Summarize data across regions

```{r}
cols_to_mutate = 6:12

#summarize across regions:
tmp = d_regional %>%
    group_by(country, region) %>% arrange(country, region,date) %>%
    #fill down 0 values, treat NA as 0 for aggregation
    fill(cols_to_mutate) %>% mutate(across(cols_to_mutate-2, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))) %>% 
    #calculate differences between points in time within groups
    mutate(across(cols_to_mutate-2, ~ . - lag(.,1,default = 0))) %>% 
    group_by(country, date) %>% 
    #sum over regions
    summarise(across(cols_to_mutate-2, sum, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    #calculate cumulative cases over time
    mutate(across(2:8, cumsum)) %>% 
    #reintroduce NAs for: Spain (State Adm.) cases/deaths staff, vaccinations in Germany
    mutate(cases_staff = ifelse(country == "Spain (State Adm.)", NA, cases_staff),
           deaths_staff = ifelse(country == "Spain (State Adm.)", NA, deaths_staff),
           `people with at least 1 dose` = NA,
           `fully vaccinated people` = ifelse(country == "Germany" | `fully vaccinated people` == 0,NA, `fully vaccinated people`),
           `administered doses` = NA)
```

- Append to complete datasets

```{r}
d = d %>%
  bind_rows(tmp %>% mutate(level = "national", period = "cumulative"))
d_vax = d_vax %>% 
  bind_rows(tmp %>% filter(!is.na(`fully vaccinated people`)) %>% select(-(3:6)) %>% mutate(level = "national", period = "cumulative"))
rm(tmp, d_regional, cols_to_mutate)
```


# 4 Check non-cumulative data

Some countries did not report cumulative data, but instead only reported data referring to specific time periods. These countries are:

```{r echo=TRUE}
d %>% filter(period != "cumulative") %>% group_by(country, period) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), min = min(date), max = max(date)) %>% knitr::kable()
```

Italy, Poland and Albania provide non-cumulative data.
For Italy and Poland, this refers to active cases, which can't be compared to new positive tests at all. Albania only provides data for the year 2021.

This data can't be compared to cumulative data points from other countries and will not be aggregated.

# 5 Relative and absolute cases / deaths

## 5.1 Absolute cases/deaths

Plot national cumulative data over time, for countries with data points in 2021.

```{r include=FALSE}
d_plot = d %>%
  group_by(country) %>% 
  filter(level == "national", period == "cumulative", country != "Italy",
         max(date) > as.Date("2021-01-01")) %>%
  select(1:9) %>% pivot_longer(6:9)


ggplot(d_plot) +
  geom_line(aes(date, value, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(aes(date, value, colour = country)) +
  geom_text(data = d_plot %>% group_by(country, name) %>%
              filter(!is.na(value)) %>% slice(which.max(date)),
            aes(label = country, colour = country, x = date, y = value), hjust = -.1) +
  scale_colour_discrete(guide = 'none') +
  scale_x_date(expand=expand_scale(mult=c(.05,.5))) +
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free_y") +
  ggtitle("COVID-19 Cases & deaths in prisons")
```
![](scripts/prisons_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)

- France has the most cases among inmates and staff, followed by Spain, Germany, Hungary and Belgium.
- Hungary has the highest death counts among inmates, although they're still very low, followed, Spain.

## 5.2 Relative cases/deaths

For better comparison, we calculate the cases and deaths relative to the prison population at the time. This can only effectively be done for inmates, since data on the number of staff isn't reliably available.

We pick the prison population size according to the closest reference date from `d_pop`. The reference date is noted in the finished data set.

```{r}
d_cases_rel = d %>% filter(level == "national", period == "cumulative") %>%
  select(1,4,6:7) %>% 
  left_join(d_pop[-4] %>% rename(date_ref = date), by = "country") %>% 
  mutate(dateDiff = abs(date - date_ref)) %>%
  group_by(country, date) %>%
  filter(dateDiff == min(dateDiff), !(is.na(cases_inmates) & is.na(deaths_inmates))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(3:4, names_to = "type") %>%
  mutate(type = gsub("_inmates","",type),
         value_rel = value/inmates)
```

Plot relative cases / deaths over time:

```{r include=FALSE}
d_plot = d_cases_rel %>% group_by(country) %>% 
  filter(!grepl("Italy", country),
         max(date) > as.Date("2021-01-01"))

ggplot(d_plot) +
  geom_line(aes(date, value_rel, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(aes(date, value_rel, colour = country)) +
  geom_text(data = d_plot %>% group_by(country, type) %>%
              filter(!is.na(value_rel)) %>% slice(which.max(date)),
            aes(label = country, colour = country, x = date, y = value_rel), hjust = -.1) +
  scale_colour_discrete(guide = 'none') +
  scale_x_date(expand=expand_scale(mult=c(.05,.4))) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 0.01)) +
  facet_wrap(~type, scales = "free_y") +
  ggtitle("COVID-19 Cases & deaths in prisons",
          subtitle = "% of inmates that tested positive / died related to COVID-19")
```
![](scripts/prisons_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)

```{r}
#Ranking of latest data:
tmp = d_cases_rel %>% group_by(country, type) %>%
  select(1:2,7:9) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value_rel), max(date) > as.Date("2021-01-01")) %>%
  slice(which.max(date)) %>% 
  arrange(type, -value_rel)
```

**Latest infection rate among inmates by country:**

`value`: Cumulative number of cases on that date

`value_rel`: Cumulative share of inmates infected until that date, in percent

```{r}
tmp %>% filter(type == "cases") %>% ungroup %>% mutate(value_rel = round(value_rel*100, 2)) %>% select(-3) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

Croatia, Slovenia, Estonia, Belgium and Spain have the highest relative number of cases, with 10-15% of inmates infected.

The latest numbers for Croatia are from the fourth wave in November 2021, while the other figures are from before the fourth wave, so the latest numbers from Croatia are not comparable with the latest numbers of other countries. They are, however, an interesting indication that cases might be rising during the fourth wave in other countries as well.

**Most recent share of deaths among inmates by country:**

`value`: Cumulative number of cases on that date

`value_rel`: Cumulative share of deaths related to COVID-19 among inmates until that date, in percent

```{r}
tmp %>% filter(type == "deaths") %>% ungroup %>% mutate(value_rel = round(value_rel*100, 2)) %>% select(-3) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

- Croatia, Hungary, Greece and Bulgaria have the most deaths related to COVID-19, followed by Belgium and Spain.
- Deaths numbers seem surprisingly low compared to the number of cases. Calculate the case fatality rate to learn more.

## 5.3 Case fatality rate

Pick latest date per country with case and death data available. Calculate CFR (share of deaths in all cases).

```{r}
d_cfr = d %>% filter(level == "national", period == "cumulative") %>%
  group_by(country) %>% select(1,4,6:7) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(cases_inmates), !is.na(deaths_inmates)) %>%
  slice(which.max(date)) %>% 
  mutate(cfr = deaths_inmates / cases_inmates) %>% 
  arrange(-cfr)

d_cfr %>% arrange(-cfr) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```
The case fatality rate is around 5% in the highest cases, but more often below 0.1%. Many countries report having had 0 deaths related to COVID-19 among inmates. That seems low considering the usual COVID-19 death rates and the risk factors among prison population. It might be an indicator of underreporting.


## 5.4 Compare cases and deaths with general population

To compare the situation in prisons with the situation in the countries around them, we use general COVID-19-figures collated by [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer) and compare:

- relative cases
- relative deaths
- case fatality rates

```{r}
d_cases_rel_pop = d_cases_rel %>%
  mutate(country_match = country %>% gsub(" \\(.+", "", .) %>% gsub(" Rep\\.$", "ia",.)) %>%
  left_join(covid_pop, by = c("country_match" = "location", "date","type")) %>% 
  select(1:2,7:9,11) %>% 
  mutate(diff_percentpoints = (value_rel - value_population_rel)*100,
         diff_percent = value_rel / value_population_rel)

```

Leave out data for Croatia from November, since it's not comparable to earlier data from the other countries, which are from before the winter 2021 wave.


**Plot relative cases in prisons compared to the general population:**

```{r include=FALSE}
d_plot = d_cases_rel_pop %>%
  group_by(country, type) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value_rel), max(date) > as.Date("2021-01-01"),
        date < as.Date("2021-11-01")) %>%
  arrange(type, -diff_percent) %>% 
  slice_max(date) %>% 
  mutate(label = paste0(country,"\n",date))

ggplot(d_plot %>% filter(type == "cases", max(date) > as.Date("2021-01-01")),
       aes(value_population_rel, value_rel, label = label,

The case fatality rate in prisons is only a fraction of that in the general population, except for Bulgaria. It seems unlikely that case fatality rates in prisons are actually this low. The more likely hypothesis would be that deaths related to COVID-19 do not get reported as reliably in prisons as they do in the general population.

# 7 Prison population and overcrowding

To get a sense of how overcrowded prison systems were at the start of the pandemic, and how things changed since then, we'll take a closer look at the prison population statistics over time.

```{r}
d_crowding = d_pop %>% arrange(country, date) %>% 
  mutate(cap_extrapolated = is.na(capacity)) %>% 
  fill(capacity, .direction = "down") %>% 
  mutate(density = inmates/capacity,
         overcrowded = density > 1)
```

## 7.1 Overcrowding at the start of the pandemic

Plot prison populations on January 1, 2020, versus official capacity.

```{r include=FALSE}
d_plot = d_crowding %>%
  group_by(country) %>% 
  filter(date == as.Date("2020-01-01"))


ggplot(d_plot, aes(density, reorder(country, density), fill = overcrowded)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Overcrowding in European prisons, start of the pandemic",
       subtitle = "Number of inmates vs. official capacity",
       x = "", y = "share of capacity filled")
```
One in three countries' prison systems (10 of 34) was operating above official capacity at the start of the pandemic.

## 7.2 Prison populations over time

Plot prison populations over time for each country:

```{r include=FALSE}
d_plot = d_crowding
d_plot$country = factor(d_plot$country, levels = d_plot %>% group_by(country) %>% 
                          slice_max(date) %>% arrange(-density) %>% `$`(country))

ggplot(d_plot, aes(date, density)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(data = d_plot %>% group_by(country) %>% filter(date == min(date) | date == max(date))) +
  facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 4) +
  theme_minimal()
```
![](graphics/345_en_prisons_popchange.png)

Many countries released a lot of prisoners at the start of the pandemic. But in many, populations are now rising again.


**Prison density at the latest available date:**

```{r}
d_crowding %>% group_by(country) %>% slice_max(date) %>% select(-c(4,6)) %>% arrange(-density) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```
10 of 34 countries still operate their prisons above their official capacity according to the latest available data, the same number of countries as at the beginning of 2020.

Of those with overcrowded prison systems at the start of the pandemic, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Austria are now below 100% (but still above 95%) of their official capacity.
Sweden, Denmark and Croatia are now overcrowded, even though they were not at the start of 2020.
